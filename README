SimpleAuthentication
====================

SimpleAuthentication is a simple, extensible and flexible authentication engine
for Rails 2.3+. It requires minimal configuration and initial setup, but is
still flexible enough to support customisation.

This is the base system which provides the framework for "authenticators" to
use to do the actual authentication. Currently there are two authenticators:

* Username/password: http://github.com/toretore/simple_password_authentication
* OpenID: http://github.com/toretore/simple_openid_authentication


Installation
============

Add the gem to your config/environment.rb file:

config.gem "toretore-simple_authentication", :source => "http://gems.github.com"
